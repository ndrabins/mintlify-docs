## Verifying Installation

You can verify your installation by creating a simple test file:

// Define a simple state type
type SimpleState = {
  count: number;
};

// Create a new graph
const builder = new StateGraph<SimpleState>({
  channels: {
    count: {
      value: (x, y) => x + y,
      default: () => 0,
    },
  },
});

console.log("LangGraph.js installed successfully!");
```

Run this file with:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npx tsx test.ts
