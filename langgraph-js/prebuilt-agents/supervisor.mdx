# LangGraph Supervisor Agent

The Supervisor Agent is a prebuilt agent in LangGraph.js that helps coordinate and manage other agents in a multi-agent system. It acts as an overseer that can delegate tasks, monitor progress, and ensure that complex workflows are executed effectively.

## Overview

The Supervisor pattern is a powerful approach for building complex agent systems. In this pattern:

1. A supervisor agent breaks down complex tasks into smaller subtasks
2. The supervisor delegates these subtasks to specialized worker agents
3. Worker agents complete their assigned tasks and report back
4. The supervisor aggregates results and ensures the overall task is completed

## Use Cases

The Supervisor Agent is particularly useful for:

- Complex workflows requiring multiple specialized agents
- Tasks that need coordination between different AI capabilities
- Scenarios where error handling and recovery are important
- Projects requiring oversight and quality control of agent outputs
- Systems that need to manage resource allocation between agents

## Installation

To use the Supervisor Agent, you need to install the LangGraph.js package:

```bash
npm install @langchain/langgraph
```

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the Supervisor Agent:

```typescript
import { SupervisorAgent, WorkerAgent } from "@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

// Create worker agents
const researchAgent = new WorkerAgent({
  name: "researcher",
  llm: new ChatOpenAI({ modelName: "gpt-4" }),
  description: "Researches information and provides factual data",
});

const writerAgent = new WorkerAgent({
  name: "writer",
  llm: new ChatOpenAI({ modelName: "gpt-4" }),
  description: "Writes creative and engaging content",
});

const editorAgent = new WorkerAgent({
  name: "editor",
  llm: new ChatOpenAI({ modelName: "gpt-4" }),
  description: "Edits and improves written content for clarity and accuracy",
});

// Create the supervisor agent
const supervisor = new SupervisorAgent({
  name: "supervisor",
  llm: new ChatOpenAI({ modelName: "gpt-4" }),
  workers: [researchAgent, writerAgent, editorAgent],
  verbose: true,
});

// Run the supervisor with a task
const result = await supervisor.execute(
  "Create a well-researched blog post about the impact of AI on healthcare"
);

console.log("Final result:", result);
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Customizing the Supervisor

You can customize the supervisor's behavior by providing additional configuration:

```typescript
const supervisor = new SupervisorAgent({
  name: "supervisor",
  llm: new ChatOpenAI({ modelName: "gpt-4" }),
  workers: [researchAgent, writerAgent, editorAgent],
  maxIterations: 10, // Maximum number of iterations
  maxWorkerIterations: 3, // Maximum iterations per worker
  supervisorSystemMessage:
    "You are a project manager coordinating a team of specialized AI agents...",
  verbose: true,
  outputParser: (output) => {
    // Custom parsing logic for the final output
    return output.trim();
  },
});
```

### Worker Agent Configuration

Worker agents can be configured with specific capabilities and constraints:

```typescript
const researchAgent = new WorkerAgent({
  name: "researcher",
  llm: new ChatOpenAI({ modelName: "gpt-4" }),
  description: "Researches information and provides factual data",
  systemMessage:
    "You are a research assistant with expertise in finding accurate information...",
  tools: [searchTool, databaseQueryTool], // Provide tools for the worker
  memory: new BufferMemory(), // Add memory to the worker
  outputParser: (output) => {
    // Custom parsing logic for this worker's output
    return { data: JSON.parse(output) };
  },
});
```

## Workflow Patterns

### Sequential Workflow

In a sequential workflow, the supervisor delegates tasks in a specific order:

```typescript
const supervisor = new SupervisorAgent({
  // ... configuration ...
  workflowPattern: "sequential",
  workflowSequence: ["researcher", "writer", "editor"],
});
```

### Parallel Workflow

In a parallel workflow, the supervisor can delegate tasks to multiple workers simultaneously:

```typescript
const supervisor = new SupervisorAgent({
  // ... configuration ...
  workflowPattern: "parallel",
});
```

### Dynamic Workflow

In a dynamic workflow (the default), the supervisor decides which workers to use based on the task:

```typescript
const supervisor = new SupervisorAgent({
  // ... configuration ...
  workflowPattern: "dynamic",
});
```

## Handling Complex Tasks

The Supervisor Agent excels at breaking down complex tasks into manageable subtasks:

```typescript
// Complex task example
const result = await supervisor.execute(`
  Create a comprehensive market analysis report for a new AI-powered healthcare product with the following components:
  1. Market overview and current trends
  2. Competitive landscape analysis
  3. Target customer segments
  4. Pricing strategy recommendations
  5. Go-to-market strategy
  
  The report should be data-driven, include relevant statistics, and provide actionable insights.
`);
```

## Error Handling and Recovery

The Supervisor Agent includes built-in error handling and recovery mechanisms:

```typescript
const supervisor = new SupervisorAgent({
  // ... configuration ...
  errorHandling: {
    retryFailedTasks: true,
    maxRetries: 3,
    fallbackStrategies: {
      // If a worker fails repeatedly, try an alternative approach
      researcher: (task, error) => {
        console.log(
          `Research failed: ${error.message}. Using backup data source.`
        );
        return backupResearchAgent.execute(task);
      },
    },
  },
});
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

The Supervisor Agent provides tools for monitoring and debugging:

```typescript
// Enable verbose logging
const supervisor = new SupervisorAgent({
  // ... configuration ...
  verbose: true,
  logLevel: "debug",
});

// Add event listeners for monitoring
supervisor.on("taskStarted", (data) => {
  console.log(`Task started: ${data.taskId} assigned to ${data.workerName}`);
});

supervisor.on("taskCompleted", (data) => {
  console.log(`Task completed: ${data.taskId} by ${data.workerName}`);
  console.log(`Result: ${data.result}`);
});

supervisor.on("error", (error) => {
  console.error(`Error in supervisor: ${error.message}`);
});
```

## Integration with External Systems

The Supervisor Agent can be integrated with external systems:

```typescript
// Integration with a task management system
const supervisor = new SupervisorAgent({
  // ... configuration ...
  hooks: {
    beforeTaskExecution: async (task, workerName) => {
      // Record task in external system
      await taskManagementSystem.createTask({
        description: task,
        assignee: workerName,
        status: "in_progress",
      });
    },
    afterTaskExecution: async (task, result, workerName) => {
      // Update task status in external system
      await taskManagementSystem.updateTask({
        description: task,
        result: result,
        assignee: workerName,
        status: "completed",
      });
    },
  },
});
```

## Human-in-the-Loop

The Supervisor Agent supports human intervention:

```typescript
const supervisor = new SupervisorAgent({
  // ... configuration ...
  humanIntervention: {
    enabled: true,
    interventionPoints: ["task_delegation", "result_review"],
    interventionHandler: async (state, point) => {
      if (point === "task_delegation") {
        // Ask human to approve or modify task delegation
        const humanFeedback = await promptHuman(
          `Please review the task delegation plan:\n${JSON.stringify(
            state.plan,
            null,
            2
          )}\n\nApprove or modify:`
        );
        return { ...state, plan: humanFeedback.plan || state.plan };
      } else if (point === "result_review") {
        // Ask human to review results
        const humanFeedback = await promptHuman(
          `Please review the results:\n${JSON.stringify(
            state.results,
            null,
            2
          )}\n\nApprove or provide feedback:`
        );
        return {
          ...state,
          approved: humanFeedback.approved,
          feedback: humanFeedback.feedback,
        };
      }
      return state;
    },
  },
});
```

## Best Practices

### Designing Effective Worker Agents

- **Clear Responsibilities**: Each worker should have a clearly defined role and responsibility
- **Specialized Capabilities**: Equip workers with tools and knowledge specific to their domain
- **Proper Descriptions**: Provide detailed descriptions to help the supervisor understand when to use each worker
- **Appropriate Model Selection**: Choose appropriate models for each worker based on their tasks

### Optimizing Supervisor Performance

- **Task Decomposition**: Ensure the supervisor is good at breaking down complex tasks
- **Clear Instructions**: Provide clear instructions to the supervisor about the overall goal
- **Iteration Management**: Set appropriate limits on iterations to prevent infinite loops
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling strategies
- **Feedback Loops**: Create feedback loops between workers and the supervisor

## Example: Content Creation Pipeline

Here's a complete example of a content creation pipeline using the Supervisor Agent:

```typescript
import { SupervisorAgent, WorkerAgent } from "@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { TavilySearchResults } from "@langchain/community/tools/tavily_search";

// Create search tool
const searchTool = new TavilySearchResults({
  apiKey: process.env.TAVILY_API_KEY,
});

// Create worker agents
const researchAgent = new WorkerAgent({
  name: "researcher",
  llm: new ChatOpenAI({ modelName: "gpt-4" }),
  description: "Researches topics and provides factual information",
  tools: [searchTool],
  systemMessage: `You are a research specialist. Your job is to gather accurate and relevant information on topics.
  Always cite your sources and provide factual, up-to-date information.`,
});

const outlineAgent = new WorkerAgent({
  name: "outliner",
  llm: new ChatOpenAI({ modelName: "gpt-4" }),
  description: "Creates structured outlines for content",
  systemMessage: `You are an outline specialist. Your job is to create well-structured outlines for content.
  Focus on logical flow, comprehensive coverage, and clear hierarchy.`,
});

const writerAgent = new WorkerAgent({
  name: "writer",
  llm: new ChatOpenAI({ modelName: "gpt-4" }),
  description: "Writes engaging and informative content",
  systemMessage: `You are a content writer. Your job is to create engaging, informative, and well-written content
  based on research and outlines provided. Focus on clarity, engagement, and value to the reader.`,
});

const editorAgent = new WorkerAgent({
  name: "editor",
  llm: new ChatOpenAI({ modelName: "gpt-4" }),
  description:
    "Edits and improves content for clarity, accuracy, and engagement",
  systemMessage: `You are an editor. Your job is to improve content by checking for accuracy, clarity, grammar,
  and engagement. Provide specific improvements and corrections.`,
});

// Create the supervisor agent
const supervisor = new SupervisorAgent({
  name: "content_manager",
  llm: new ChatOpenAI({ modelName: "gpt-4" }),
  workers: [researchAgent, outlineAgent, writerAgent, editorAgent],
  supervisorSystemMessage: `You are a content manager overseeing a team of specialists who create high-quality content.
  Your job is to:
  1. Break down content creation requests into specific tasks
  2. Assign tasks to the appropriate specialists
  3. Coordinate the workflow between research, outlining, writing, and editing
  4. Ensure the final content meets the requirements and is of high quality
  
  Available specialists:
  - researcher: Researches topics and provides factual information
  - outliner: Creates structured outlines for content
  - writer: Writes engaging and informative content
  - editor: Edits and improves content for clarity, accuracy, and engagement`,
  verbose: true,
});

// Execute a content creation task
async function createContent(topic) {
  console.log(`Starting content creation for topic: ${topic}`);

  const result = await supervisor.execute(
    `Create a comprehensive, engaging, and informative blog post about "${topic}". 
    The post should be well-researched, factually accurate, and provide valuable insights to readers.
    Target length: 1000-1500 words.`
  );

  console.log("Content creation completed!");
  return result;
}

// Run the content creation pipeline
createContent("The Future of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare")
  .then((content) => {
    console.log("Final content:");
    console.log(content);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error creating content:", error);
  });
```

## Conclusion

The Supervisor Agent provides a powerful framework for building complex, multi-agent systems in LangGraph.js. By coordinating specialized worker agents, it can tackle sophisticated tasks that would be difficult for a single agent to handle effectively.
