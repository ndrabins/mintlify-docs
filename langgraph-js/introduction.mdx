## What is LangGraph.js?

LangGraph.js is a TypeScript/JavaScript library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. It provides a flexible framework for creating complex AI workflows, agent systems, and stateful applications.

<Note>
  LangGraph.js is the JavaScript/TypeScript implementation of LangGraph, which
  was originally developed for Python.

### Key Features

- **Stateful Execution**: Maintain and manage state across multiple steps in your AI workflows
- **Graph-based Architecture**: Define complex flows with nodes and edges for flexible application design
- **Checkpointing**: Save and resume execution state for long-running processes
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Easily integrate human feedback and intervention in your AI systems
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Build systems with multiple specialized agents working together
- **TypeScript Integration**: Fully typed API for better developer experience and code safety

## Why use LangGraph?

LangGraph provides fine-grained control over both the flow and state of your agent applications. It implements a central persistence layer, enabling features that are common to most agent architectures:

- **Memory**: LangGraph persists arbitrary aspects of your application's state, supporting memory of conversations and other updates within and across user interactions
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Because state is checkpointed, execution can be interrupted and resumed, allowing for decisions, validation, and corrections at key stages via human input

Standardizing these components allows individuals and teams to focus on the behavior of their agent, instead of its supporting infrastructure.

## LangGraph Platform

LangGraph Platform is infrastructure for deploying LangGraph agents. It is a commercial solution for deploying agentic applications to production, built on the open-source LangGraph framework. The LangGraph Platform consists of several components that work together to support the development, deployment, debugging, and monitoring of LangGraph applications:

- **LangGraph Server (APIs)**: Backend services for running your agents
- **LangGraph SDKs**: Client libraries for interacting with the server
- **LangGraph CLI**: Command line tools for building and deploying
- **LangGraph Studio**: Visual UI for debugging and monitoring

The platform addresses common challenges in production deployments:

- **Streaming support**: Multiple streaming modes optimized for various application needs
- **Background runs**: Run agents asynchronously in the background
- **Support for long-running agents**: Infrastructure for handling long-running processes
- **Double texting**: Handle cases where you get two messages from the user before the agent can respond
- **Handle burstiness**: Task queue for ensuring requests are handled consistently without loss
