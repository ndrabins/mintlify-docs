## What are Nodes?

Nodes are the processing units in a LangGraph.js graph. Each node:

1. Receives the current state
2. Performs some operation or computation
3. Returns a modified state

Nodes are where the actual work happens in your graph. They can perform a wide range of tasks, from simple data transformations to complex operations like calling LLMs, accessing external APIs, or executing tools.

## Adding Nodes to a Graph

You add nodes to a StateGraph using the `addNode` method:

```typescript
builder.addNode("node_name", {
  execute: async (state) => {
    // Process the state
    // ...

    // Return a partial state with updates
    return {
      someProperty: updatedValue,
    };
  },
});
```

The `addNode` method takes two arguments:

- A unique name for the node
- A configuration object with an `execute` function

## The Execute Function

The `execute` function is the heart of a node. It:

1. Receives the current state as its argument
2. Performs some operation
3. Returns a partial state with updates

```typescript
execute: async (state) => {
  // Access state properties
  const messages = state.messages;
  const context = state.context;

  // Perform operations
  const result = await someOperation(messages, context);

  // Return partial state with updates
  return {
    messages: [new AIMessage(result)],
    context: { processed: true },
  };
};
```

The returned object doesn't need to include all state properties - only the ones that have changed. The graph will merge this partial state with the existing state using the channel merge functions.

## Node Types and Patterns

While all nodes have the same basic structure, they can serve different purposes in your graph. Here are common node types and patterns:

### Input Processing Nodes

These nodes process and validate input:

```typescript
builder.addNode("process_input", {
  execute: async (state) => {
    const lastMessage = state.messages[state.messages.length - 1];

    // Extract and process information from the input
    const entities = extractEntities(lastMessage.content);
    const intent = classifyIntent(lastMessage.content);

    return {
      context: {
        entities,
        intent,
        processed: true,
      },
    };
  },
});
```

### LLM Nodes

These nodes call language models to generate responses:

```typescript
builder.addNode("generate_response", {
  execute: async (state) => {
    const model = new ChatOpenAI({
      modelName: "gpt-4",
      temperature: 0.7,
    });

    const response = await model.invoke(state.messages);

    return {
      messages: [response],
    };
  },
});
```

### Tool Execution Nodes

These nodes execute tools or call external APIs:

```typescript
builder.addNode("search_tool", {
  execute: async (state) => {
    const query = state.context.searchQuery;
    const searchResults = await webSearch.search(query);

    return {
      context: {
        searchResults,
      },
    };
  },
});
```

### Routing Nodes

These nodes don't modify the state but determine the next node to execute:

```typescript
builder.addNode("router", {
  execute: async (state) => {
    // Determine the next step based on the state
    // The actual routing is done by conditional edges
    const intent = state.context.intent;

    return {
      context: {
        nextStep: intent,
      },
    };
  },
});

// Then use conditional edges to route based on the nextStep
builder.addConditionalEdges("router", (state) => state.context.nextStep, {
  search: "search_tool",
  calculate: "calculator_tool",
  respond: "generate_response",
});
```

### Aggregation Nodes

These nodes combine results from multiple paths:

```typescript
builder.addNode("aggregator", {
  execute: async (state) => {
    const searchResults = state.context.searchResults || [];
    const calculationResults = state.context.calculationResults || [];

    // Combine the results
    const combinedResults = [...searchResults, ...calculationResults];

    return {
      context: {
        combinedResults,
      },
    };
  },
});
```

## Asynchronous Operations

Nodes can perform asynchronous operations using `async/await`:

```typescript
builder.addNode("async_node", {
  execute: async (state) => {
    // Perform asynchronous operations
    const result1 = await someAsyncOperation();
    const result2 = await anotherAsyncOperation();

    return {
      context: {
        result1,
        result2,
      },
    };
  },
});
```

## Error Handling

It's important to handle errors in your nodes to prevent the graph from crashing:

```typescript
builder.addNode("error_handling_node", {
  execute: async (state) => {
    try {
      const result = await riskyOperation();
      return {
        context: { result, success: true },
      };
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error in node:", error);
      return {
        context: {
          error: error.message,
          success: false,
        },
      };
    }
  },
});
```

## Stateless Nodes

Sometimes you might want a node that doesn't modify the state but performs some side effect:

```typescript
builder.addNode("logging_node", {
  execute: async (state) => {
    // Log the current state
    console.log("Current state:", state);

    // Return an empty object to not modify the state
    return {};
  },
});
```

## Reusing Node Logic

For complex applications, you might want to reuse node logic across different graphs:

```typescript
// Define a reusable node function
const createLLMNode = (modelName, temperature) => ({
  execute: async (state) => {
    const model = new ChatOpenAI({
      modelName,
      temperature,
    });

    const response = await model.invoke(state.messages);

    return {
      messages: [response],
    };
  },
});

// Use it in different graphs
builder1.addNode("llm_node", createLLMNode("gpt-4", 0.7));
builder2.addNode("llm_node", createLLMNode("gpt-3.5-turbo", 0.5));
```

    Each node should perform a single, well-defined task. This makes your graph
    easier to understand, test, and maintain.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use descriptive node names">
    Choose clear, descriptive names for your nodes that indicate their purpose.
    This makes your graph easier to understand and debug.

  <Accordion title="Handle errors gracefully">
    Implement error handling in your nodes to ensure your graph can recover from
    failures.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Minimize state updates">
    Only return the state properties that have actually changed. This makes your
    code more efficient and easier to understand.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document complex nodes">
    For complex nodes, add comments explaining what the node does and how it
    modifies the state.
