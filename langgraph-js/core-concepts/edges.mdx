## What are Edges?

Edges define the flow of execution between nodes in a LangGraph.js graph. They determine:

1. Which node executes after the current node completes
2. Under what conditions a particular path is followed
3. How the graph branches and merges

Edges are what turn a collection of nodes into a coherent workflow. They allow you to create linear sequences, branches, loops, and complex conditional flows.

## Types of Edges

LangGraph.js supports two main types of edges:

1. **Static Edges**: Always follow the same path
2. **Conditional Edges**: Choose a path based on the state

## Static Edges

Static edges create a fixed path between nodes. They're added using the `addEdge` method:

```typescript
// Connect "node_a" to "node_b"
builder.addEdge("node_a", "node_b");

// Connect "node_b" to "node_c"
builder.addEdge("node_b", "node_c");
```

This creates a linear flow: `node_a` → `node_b` → `node_c`.

## Special Node Identifiers

LangGraph.js provides two special node identifiers:

- `"start"`: The entry point of the graph
- `END`: The exit point of the graph

```typescript
import { END } from "@langchain/langgraph";

// Connect the first node to the start
builder.addEdge("start", "first_node");

// Connect the last node to the end
builder.addEdge("last_node", END);
```

Every graph must have at least one edge from `"start"` and one edge to `END`.

## Conditional Edges

Conditional edges choose a path based on the current state. They're added using the `addConditionalEdges` method:

```typescript
builder.addConditionalEdges(
  "router_node", // Source node
  (state) => {
    // Condition function
    if (state.context.needsSearch) {
      return "search";
    } else if (state.context.needsCalculation) {
      return "calculate";
    } else {
      return "respond";
    }
  },
  {
    // Routes
    search: "search_tool",
    calculate: "calculator_tool",
    respond: "generate_response",
  }
);
```

The `addConditionalEdges` method takes three arguments:

1. The source node
2. A condition function that returns a string key
3. A routes object mapping keys to destination nodes

## Condition Functions

The condition function receives the current state and returns a string key that determines which path to follow:

```typescript
(state) => {
  // Examine the state
  const intent = state.context.intent;

  // Return a key that matches one of the routes
  return intent;
};
```

The returned key must match one of the keys in the routes object. If it doesn't, an error will be thrown.

## Simplified Condition Functions

For simple conditions, you can return a property of the state directly:

```typescript
// If state.context.nextStep contains the route key
builder.addConditionalEdges("router", (state) => state.context.nextStep, {
  search: "search_tool",
  calculate: "calculator_tool",
  respond: "generate_response",
});
```

## Ending the Graph

To end the graph from a conditional edge, use the `END` constant:

```typescript
import { END } from "@langchain/langgraph";

builder.addConditionalEdges(
  "final_router",
  (state) => (state.context.shouldEnd ? "end" : "continue"),
  {
    end: END,
    continue: "next_node",
  }
);
```

## Creating Loops

You can create loops by adding an edge that points back to a previous node:

```typescript
// Create a loop from "check_condition" to "process_item"
builder.addConditionalEdges(
  "check_condition",
  (state) => (state.context.hasMoreItems ? "continue" : "done"),
  {
    continue: "process_item", // Loop back
    done: "finish",
  }
);

// Connect "process_item" to "check_condition"
builder.addEdge("process_item", "check_condition");
```

This creates a loop: `check_condition` → `process_item` → `check_condition` → ...

## Branching and Merging

You can create branches by having multiple edges from a single node, and merge them by having multiple edges to a single node:

```typescript
// Branching
builder.addConditionalEdges("router", (state) => state.context.route, {
  a: "branch_a",
  b: "branch_b",
  c: "branch_c",
});

// Merging
builder.addEdge("branch_a", "aggregator");
builder.addEdge("branch_b", "aggregator");
builder.addEdge("branch_c", "aggregator");
```

When paths merge, the states from each path are combined using the channel merge functions.

## Parallel Execution

LangGraph.js doesn't natively support parallel execution within a single graph invocation. However, you can simulate parallel execution by:

1. Branching the graph
2. Running each branch separately
3. Merging the results

```typescript
// Create branches
builder.addConditionalEdges("router", (state) => state.context.route, {
  a: "branch_a",
  b: "branch_b",
});

// Each branch does its work
builder.addNode("branch_a", {
  /* ... */
});
builder.addNode("branch_b", {
  /* ... */
});

// Merge the results
builder.addEdge("branch_a", "aggregator");
builder.addEdge("branch_b", "aggregator");

// Aggregator combines the results
builder.addNode("aggregator", {
  execute: async (state) => {
    // The state here will have the combined results from both branches
    // thanks to the channel merge functions
    return {
      context: {
        combinedResults: true,
      },
    };
  },
});
```

## Complex Routing Patterns

You can create complex routing patterns by combining static and conditional edges:

### State Machine

```typescript
// Define a state machine with different states
builder.addConditionalEdges(
  "state_router",
  (state) => state.context.currentState,
  {
    idle: "idle_handler",
    processing: "processing_handler",
    error: "error_handler",
    complete: "complete_handler",
  }
);

// Each handler updates the state and routes back to the router
builder.addNode("idle_handler", {
  execute: async (state) => {
    return {
      context: {
        currentState: "processing",
      },
    };
  },
});

builder.addEdge("idle_handler", "state_router");
builder.addEdge("processing_handler", "state_router");
builder.addEdge("error_handler", "state_router");
builder.addEdge("complete_handler", END);
```

### Multi-Step Process

```typescript
// Define a multi-step process
builder.addEdge("start", "step1");
builder.addEdge("step1", "step2");

// Conditional check after step2
builder.addConditionalEdges(
  "step2",
  (state) => (state.context.step2Success ? "success" : "retry"),
  {
    success: "step3",
    retry: "step2", // Loop back to retry
  }
);

builder.addEdge("step3", END);
```

  <Accordion title="Be careful with loops">
    Ensure that loops have a clear exit condition to prevent infinite loops.
