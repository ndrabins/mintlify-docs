## What is a StateGraph?

The `StateGraph` is the fundamental building block in LangGraph.js. It represents a directed graph where:

- **Nodes** are functions or components that process state
- **Edges** define the flow between nodes
- **State** is passed between nodes and can be modified

A StateGraph provides a structured way to define complex workflows with multiple steps, branching logic, and state management.

## Creating a StateGraph

To create a StateGraph, you first need to define the shape of your state using TypeScript types:

```typescript
type AgentState = {
  messages: (HumanMessage | AIMessage)[];
  context: Record<string, any>;
  tools: ToolInterface[];
};
```

Then, you can create a new StateGraph instance:

```typescript
import { StateGraph } from "@langchain/langgraph";

const builder = new StateGraph<AgentState>({
  channels: {
    messages: {
      value: (x, y) => [...x, ...y],
      default: () => [],
    },
    context: {
      value: (x, y) => ({ ...x, ...y }),
      default: () => ({}),
    },
    tools: {
      value: (x, y) => [...x, ...y],
      default: () => [],
    },
  },
});
```

The `channels` parameter defines how each part of the state is managed and merged throughout the graph execution.

## Adding Nodes

Nodes are the processing units in your graph. Each node receives the current state, performs some operation, and returns a modified state:

```typescript
builder.addNode("process_input", {
  execute: async (state) => {
    // Process the input and return modified state
    return {
      context: {
        ...state.context,
        processed: true,
        timestamp: Date.now(),
      },
    };
  },
});

builder.addNode("generate_response", {
  execute: async (state) => {
    const model = new ChatOpenAI({});
    const response = await model.invoke(state.messages);
    return {
      messages: [response],
    };
  },
});
```

## Adding Edges

Edges define the flow of execution between nodes:

```typescript
// Static edges
builder.addEdge("start", "process_input");
builder.addEdge("process_input", "generate_response");
builder.addEdge("generate_response", "end");
```

You can also add conditional edges that choose a path based on the state:

```typescript
builder.addConditionalEdges(
  "router",
  (state) => {
    if (state.context.needsSearch) {
      return "search";
    } else if (state.context.needsCalculation) {
      return "calculate";
    } else {
      return "respond";
    }
  },
  {
    search: "search_tool",
    calculate: "calculator_tool",
    respond: "generate_response",
  }
);
```

## Special Nodes: START and END

LangGraph.js provides two special node identifiers:

- `"start"` - The entry point of the graph
- `END` - The exit point of the graph

```typescript
import { END } from "@langchain/langgraph";

// Connect the first node to the start
builder.addEdge("start", "first_node");

// Connect the last node to the end
builder.addEdge("last_node", END);
```

## Compiling and Running the Graph

Once you've defined your graph, you need to compile it before you can run it:

```typescript
const graph = builder.compile();
```

You can then invoke the graph with an initial state:

```typescript
const result = await graph.invoke({
  messages: [new HumanMessage("Hello, how are you?")],
  context: {},
  tools: [],
});
```

## Streaming Execution

You can also stream the execution of the graph to get updates as each node completes:

```typescript
const stream = await graph.stream({
  messages: [new HumanMessage("Hello, how are you?")],
});

for await (const state of stream) {
  console.log("Current state:", state);
}
```

## Checkpointing

StateGraphs support checkpointing, which allows you to save and restore the state of the graph:

```typescript
const graph = builder.compile({
  checkpointer: new InMemoryCheckpointer(),
});

// Run with a specific thread ID
const result = await graph.invoke(
  { messages: [new HumanMessage("Hello")] },
  { configurable: { thread_id: "conversation-123" } }
);

// Later, continue the same thread
const continuedResult = await graph.invoke(
  { messages: [new HumanMessage("Follow-up question")] },
  { configurable: { thread_id: "conversation-123" } }
);
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep nodes focused">
    Design each node to perform a single, well-defined task. This makes your
    graph easier to understand, test, and maintain.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use descriptive node names">
    Choose clear, descriptive names for your nodes that indicate their purpose.
    This makes your graph easier to understand and debug.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Plan your state structure">
    Carefully design your state structure to include all the information needed
    by your nodes, while avoiding unnecessary complexity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Handle errors gracefully">
    Implement error handling in your nodes to ensure your graph can recover from
    failures.
